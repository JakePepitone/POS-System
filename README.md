# Point of Sale (POS) System

## Overview
This project is a Point of Sale (POS) system developed to support core retail and restaurant operations, including order processing, transaction management, and user interaction through a streamlined interface. The system was designed with an emphasis on usability, modularity, and real-world business workflows.

## Project Purpose
The goal of this project was to simulate a practical POS environment that reflects how modern retail and food-service systems operate. It focuses on handling orders efficiently, supporting multiple transaction types, and providing a foundation that can be extended with features such as inventory tracking, loyalty programs, and reporting.

## Key Features
- Order creation and management  
- Transaction processing workflow  
- Menu or product-based item selection  
- Modular structure to support future expansion  
- User-friendly interface design  

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Kotlin  
- Development Environment: Android Studio  
- UI Framework: Jetpack Compose  
- Platform: Android  

## System Design
The POS system is structured to separate business logic from the user interface, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability. Core components handle order data, transaction flow, and UI state management, reflecting principles used in production-grade POS systems.

## Repository Structure
- `ui/` – User interface components and screens  
- `model/` – Data models for orders, items, and transactions  
- `logic/` – Core business logic and transaction handling  
- `utils/` – Helper functions and shared utilities  

## Current Status
This project is a functional prototype and continues to evolve as features and refinements are added.
